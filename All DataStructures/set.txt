Method								Description
add(element/immutable iterable)		Adds an element/immutable iterable(tuple) to the set, If the element already exists, the add() method does not add the element.
update(iterable)					Update the set with another set, or any other iterable

clear()			Removes all the elements from the set
discard(value)	Remove the specified item, discard() method will not raise an error if the specified item does not exist.
pop()			Removes a random element from the set
remove(value)	Removes the specified element, will raise an KeyError if the specified item does not exist

copy()			Returns a copy of the set

difference(set)					Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets, S1-S2
difference_update(set)			Removes the items from the set, those are also present in another specified set
intersection(set) AND			Returns a set, that is the intersection of two or more sets, S1&S2
intersection_update(set)		Keeps the items in the set that also present in other, specified set(s)
symmetric_difference(set) XOR	Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets,  S1^S2
symmetric_difference_update(set)	inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another
union(set1, set2...) OR			Return a set containing the union of sets, S1|S2

isdisjoint(set)		Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not, T: no intersection exist, F: intersection exist
issubset(set)		Returns whether another set contains this set or not, S1<S2
issuperset(set)		Returns whether this set contains another set or not, S1>S2
