queue.LifoQueue(maxsize=0)
Method					Description
qsize()					Return the approximate size of the queue. Note, qsize() > 0 doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent get() will not block, nor will qsize() < maxsize guarantee that put() will not block.
empty()					Return True if the queue is empty, False otherwise. If empty() returns True it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent call to put() will not block. Similarly, if empty() returns False it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent call to get() will not block.
full()					Return True if the queue is full, False otherwise. If full() returns True it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent call to get() will not block. Similarly, if full() returns False it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent call to put() will not block.
put(item, block=True, timeout=None)	Put item into the queue. If optional args block is true and timeout is None (the default), 
					block if necessary until a free slot is available. If timeout is a positive number, 
					it blocks at most timeout seconds and raises the Full exception if no free slot was available within that time. 
					Otherwise (block is false), put an item on the queue if a free slot is immediately available, else raise the Full exception (timeout is ignored in that case).
get(block=True, timeout=None)		Remove and return an item from the queue. If optional args block is true and timeout is None (the default), block if necessary 
					until an item is available. If timeout is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds and raises the Empty exception 
					if no item was available within that time. Otherwise (block is false), return an item if one is immediately available, 
					else raise the Empty exception (timeout is ignored in that case).
task_done()				Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete. Used by queue consumer threads. For each get() used to fetch a task, a subsequent call to task_done() tells the queue that the processing on the task is complete.
